\x1B[1mThe\x1B[0m \x1B[1m{city.title()}\x1B[0m City Council wants to bring a 
Women’s National \x1B[1m{sport.capitalize()}\x1B[0m Association team to \x1B[1m{city.capitalize()}\x1B[0m.

On \x1B[1m{day.capitalize()}\x1B[0m, the council approved a resolution urging the association 
to establish a team in \x1B[1m{city.capitalize()}\x1B[0m, noting the city already has 
the existing stadium infrastructure and a passionate fan base needed 
to foster a successful franchise. 

A handful of other cities including \x1B[1m{city2.title()}\x1B[0m are also attempting to court 
a franchise. Kathy Englebert, the commissioner, confirmed in 
\x1B[1m{month.capitalize()}\x1B[0m that the league is looking to add \x1B[1m{number1}\x1B[0m or \x1B[1m{number2}\x1B[0m teams, 
potentially for the \x1B[1m{year}\x1B[0m season. 

The association has \x1B[1m{number3}\x1B[0m teams and hasn’t expanded since the Atlanta Dream joined in 2008.
